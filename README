Hash Arrays written by Dan Reed
last updated 11/23/11


This is a toy project I wrote for a talk on hash arrays, and using them
to store sets of ever growing data, like profiles on a webforum or
social media site.

To compile(from terminal, cli, dos prompt, whatever you want):
javac *java
java main

you might want to give the JVM more heap memory:
java -Xmx1024m main

This program creates an array of a million buckets, then fills the buckets
using either chain hashing or linear probing to deal with collisions.
There are 5 included hash methods: java hashCode, SHA-1, MD5, jenkin's hash,
and a simple ascii summation hash.

With this data, the program creates 3 pictures: a .png showing the results
of how the array was filled, a .gif detailing the process of filling the
array, and a companion .png that gives a rough key to decipher what happened.

You can change the gradients, the frames in the .gif, and nearly everything
about the array. This makes some really interesting images to look at and
decipher.

Use this however you want, but send me an email at dan@danreed.net if you
think it's cool. I'd like that.
